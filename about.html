                            <p> Patrick Loewen was in kitchens since he was a young boy. From his first shifts cutting
                                chips,
                                in an Irish boarding school,where his Canadian Mother had been unable to maintain
                                boarding
                                fees,
                                he knew he had found a home. <img class="img-fluid" src="img/patrick.jpg"
                                    alt="Card image cap"> His childhood had been rocky, and it was in the kitchens of
                                Ireland,
                                and Western Canada that he grew up. A brief stint at the Emily Carr, School of Art in
                                Vancouver,
                                is reflected in his use of colour, and his philosophies about food and human culture,
                                are
                                deeply
                                rooted in his work, and the people around him.
                                "The culinary arts, are the greatest arts in my opinion, because they capture all five
                                senses,
                                and
                                it is an activity shared across the entire spectrum of humanity. The very act of walking
                                upright
                                was
                                caused by our adaptive diet at the end of the ice age. Meals are tied to memories, and
                                history.
                                They
                                celebrate occasions and traditions. To have control, even in just the slightest way, of
                                such
                                a
                                powerful
                                force, is exhilirating." - Patrick Loewen
                                Patrick began cooking in the West of Ireland as a teenager, after boarding school. He
                                moved
                                home
                                to Canada at ninteen years old, and began working as a potwasher under Corey Pelan. He
                                completed
                                his
                                aprentiship, and moved to the Coast Hotel in Victoria, British Columbia, where they
                                catered
                                to such
                                events
                                as G8 Summits, and Hollywood cast wrap up Parties. He then went to the Hotel Grand
                                Pacific,
                                at the
                                time
                                Canada's #1 5* Hotel, and assisted catering in such high scale events as the Emporor of
                                Japan's
                                visit to
                                the Governor Generals Mansion. He then relocatted to the Inn at Laurel Point, to work in
                                both
                                pastries
                                and savories, under the leadership of Bradd Horen, the Captain of the Canadian National
                                Culinary
                                Team.
                                He assisted in traing with the team, and finished his pastry diploma program. This hotel
                                was
                                the
                                only
                                hotel of that scale in Western Canada to make all of its own breads and pastries, from
                                breakfast
                                croissants,
                                to burger buns. It was shortly after this hotel, that Patrick and his wife opened their
                                own
                                bakery
                                which
                                was soon after purchased from them for a lucrative proffit. With this money he moved
                                back to
                                Ireland, with
                                his wife and two baby boys. He brought with him a sense of adventure found in Western
                                Canadian
                                cuisine, and
                                settled in Dublin, eventually working as a sous chef for Irish Master Chef host, Dylan
                                McGragh
                                before moving
                                to Galway, where he head chef'd one of the countries most prestigious seafood
                                restaurants.
                                He has
                                cooked

                                and butcher. He has a deep knowledge of the industry, in forms of creativity, marketing,

                                His understanding of food, service, and motivation are surpassed only by his
                                passion for them.</p>
