				<p> <img class="img-fluid" src="img/patrick.jpg" alt="Card image cap"> Patrick Loewen was in kitchens since he was a young boy.  From his first shifts cutting chips,<br>
						in an Irish boarding school,where his Canadian Mother had been unable to maintain boarding fees,<br>
						he knew he had found a home.  His childhood had been rocky, and it was in the kitchens of Ireland,<br>
						and Western Canada that he grew up. A brief stint at the Emily Carr, School of Art in Vancouver,<br>
						is reflected in his use of colour, and his philosophies about food and human culture, are deeply<br>
						rooted in his work, and the people around him.<br>
						"The culinary arts, are the greatest arts in my opinion, because they capture all five senses, and<br>
						it is an activity shared across the entire spectrum of humanity.  The very act of walking upright was<br>
						caused by our adaptive diet at the end of the ice age. Meals are tied to memories, and history. They<br>
						celebrate occasions and traditions.  To have control, even in just the slightest way, of such a powerful<br> 
						force, is exhilirating." - Patrick Loewen<br>
						Patrick began cooking in the West of Ireland as a teenager, after boarding school. He moved home<br>
						to Canada at ninteen years old, and began working as a potwasher under Corey Pelan. He completed his<br>
						aprentiship, and moved to the Coast Hotel in Victoria, British Columbia, where they catered to such events<br> 
						as G8 Summits, and Hollywood cast wrap up Parties.  He then went to the Hotel Grand Pacific, at the time <br>
						Canada's #1 5* Hotel, and assisted catering in such high scale events as the Emporor of Japan's visit to<br>
						the Governor Generals Mansion. He then relocatted to the Inn at Laurel Point, to work in both pastries<br> 
						and savories, under the leadership of Bradd Horen, the Captain of the Canadian National Culinary Team.<br> 
						He assisted in traing with the team, and finished his pastry diploma program.  This hotel was the only<br>
						hotel of that scale in Western Canada to make all of its own breads and pastries, from breakfast croissants,<br>
						to burger buns.  It was shortly after this hotel, that Patrick and his wife opened their own bakery which<br>
						was soon after purchased from them for a lucrative proffit.  With this money he moved back to Ireland, with<br> 
						his wife and two baby boys.  He brought with him a sense of adventure found in Western Canadian cuisine, and<br>
						settled in Dublin, eventually working as a sous chef for Irish Master Chef host, Dylan McGragh before moving<br>
						to Galway, where he head chef'd one of the countries most prestigious seafood restaurants. He has cooked<br> 
						competitivley for over a decade, and has a list of medals and achievments.  He is an acredited chef, pastry chef,<br>
						and butcher.  He has a deep knowledge of the industry, in forms of creativity, marketing, efficincy, and financials.<br>
						His understanding of food, service, and motivation are surpassed only by his<br> 
						passion for them.</p>
